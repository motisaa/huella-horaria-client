# Huella Horaria Client

This is my final project for my higher education in Web Application Development, made using React on the client side. Its primary function is to enable workers to clock in and out. To achieve this, I used several libraries such as Moment.js and Moment Timezone for proficient handling of date and time. Additionally, Axios was utilized for facilitating the retrieval and transmission of data to the backend. Furthermore, I incorporated the navigator API to track the location, providing HR with the ability to monitor employee presence in the office.
